# Booking System Chatbot

## Some notes
To everyone who will see this project, I am new to git and github so pardon my ignorance with a lot of things. I just wanted to save the projects I made during my time in college in cloud and share it with others.

## Description
This is a simple booking system chatbot project created in compliance with our subject Data Structures and Algorithms. I used Python and Visual Studio Code for this project.

For the starting point of the project, I watched this tutorial by **Hex CG**:

## What is included in the system
- (Fictional) SunCity Hotel and Resort booking system with a chatbot virtual assistant called Eve
- View contacts of the hotel and resort
- View amenities 
- View the types of room available
- View the available branches of the hotel and resort
- Book a reservation (but details are not saved in a database)

## What I want to improve
- Saving the user's booking details in a database
- able to validate the format of dates and emails when the user types the answer
- changing how the room description and amenities are presented for better readability
- giving the user options to choose and select from, rather than them always typing the answer
- There are problems with how it answers questions because of the code (It chooses an answer for a different question than what you asked as you ask more questions)
